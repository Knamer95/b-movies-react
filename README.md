# B-Movies React

## Introduction

I used `React 17` with `vite`.

The project uses `Redux` to store data from the server, and `axios` for the requests.

For the forms, I used `React Hook Form`.


## Installation

1) Clone repository
 
2) Go to the root folder

3) Run the command `npm install`

Once it's done, we can serve the project with `npm run dev`


## Steps to follow

1) Create an .env file if there is none in the root (can be created elsewhere if desired)

2) Add the variables VITE_GATEWAY, with our Symfony API URL (in my repository [b-movies-symfony-api](https://github.com/Knamer95/b-movies-symfony-api). In my case it is `http://localhost:80/b-movie-api/public`
	

## Conclusions

This project was used as a learning tool that helped me learn how Redux works.

It also helped me understand the concept of lazy loading in React :)
